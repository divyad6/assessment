            <h2>Instructions for Administration</h2>
                <p>1. Before the questionnaire is administered, try to get the person to sit down facing you. Assess the person’s ability to hear and understand very simple conversation, e.g., "What is your name?" If the person uses hearing or visual aids, provide these before starting.</p>
                <p>2. Introduce yourself and try to get the person’s confidence. Before you begin, get the person’s permission to ask questions, e.g., "Would it be alright to ask you some questions about your memory?" This helps to avoid catastrophic reactions. Then say, "I am going to ask you some questions and give you some problems to solve. Please try to answer as best as you can."</p>
                <p>3. Ask each question a maximum of three times. If the subject does not respond, score 0.</p>
                <p>4. If the person answers incorrectly, score 0. Accept that answer and do not ask the question again, hint, or provide any physical clues such as head shaking, etc.</p>
                <p>5. You will need a blank piece of paper, a pencil, an eraser, and a wristwatch. The required images below (click to download) will all be provided when necessary, and images of a pencil and wristwatch are included in case you don't have them on hand. Regardless, please make sure you have something to write with.</p>

                </p>
                <p>6. If the person answers: "What did you say?", do not explain or engage in conversation. Merely repeat the same directions a maximum of three times.</p>
                <p>7. If the person interrupts (e.g., "What is this for?"), reply: "I will explain in a few minutes, when we are finished. Now if we could proceed please… we are almost finished."</p>
                <p>8. Each section will have a time allotted. Please allow the person a maximum of the time allotted for each question in the section. There will be a timer provided, which you can open using the button on the right of the screen.</p>
            <p><strong>You will be able to view these instructions again at any time during the test.</strong></p>
